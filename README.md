# Godot C# Tutorials and Snippets

Godot C# tutorials and code snippets to help C# programmers in the game development world.

## A little about me

I am an expert C# programmer who is passionate about knowledge sharing and building things together. After years of privately sharing my insights with people in the projects and companies I've worked for, I've decided to make my small contributions and advice to the C# community public. And I'm starting with Godot, this amazing game engine. 

## Together we are strong

ðŸ’¡ Do you have a nice idea for a project using C# (Game/Web/Desktop/Mobile)? Feel free to share it with me. 

> Big things start small, remember that! ;-)

You can find me in the [Godot Forum community](https://forum.godotengine.org/u/vrravalos).

Have a look at my Godot plugin: ["AutoSaver for Godot"](https://github.com/vrravalos/AutoSaver-for-Godot).

## Purpose ðŸ™Œ

- To provide hands-on tutorials and examples for developing Godot games using C#. 
- To help C# programmers learn how to use the Godot engine.
